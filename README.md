Hey 👋 What's up?
I'm Moisés Castillo, a passionate web developer originally from Venezuela. With two years of experience in web development, I've specialized mainly in front end, although I also have a basic knowledge of back end.

My skills include an almost advanced mastery of HTML and CSS, as well as an intermediate level in JavaScript and React. I love to create attractive and functional interfaces that enhance the user experience.

In addition to my core competencies, I have familiarity with other technologies such as Git, GitHub, Bootstrap, Material UI, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. While I am not fully proficient in them, I have the ability to use them and adapt quickly to new tools and environments.

I'm excited to keep learning and growing in the web development world, always looking 🔭 for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects.
